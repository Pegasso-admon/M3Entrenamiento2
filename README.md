# 🧠 Data Management with JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to manage and display data using JavaScript's core data structures: **Objects**, **Sets**, and **Maps**. It is styled with the **Bulma CSS framework** and fully responsive. The layout centers the content vertically and keeps the footer at the bottom of the viewport.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The `products` object holds all product information.
2. A `Set` is used to eliminate duplicate product names.
3. A `Map` organizes products by category.
4. JavaScript dynamically generates a product list on the page.
5. Bulma is used for layout, with additional styles in `style.css`.
